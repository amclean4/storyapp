      Little Red Riding Hood is a young girl who sets out to visit her sick grandmother, carrying a basket of food. Her mother warns her to stay on the path, but along the way, she encounters a cunning wolf who tricks her into revealing her destination. The wolf rushes ahead to the grandmother’s house, eats her, and disguises himself in her clothing to deceive Little Red Riding Hood when she arrives.

      Upon entering, Little Red Riding Hood notices something strange about her "grandmother," but before she can react, the wolf swallows her whole. Fortunately, a passing huntsman hears the commotion, enters the house, and cuts open the wolf’s belly, freeing both the grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood. They fill the wolf’s stomach with heavy stones, leading to his demise. In some versions, the girl learns her lesson about talking to strangers and becomes more cautious in the future.
